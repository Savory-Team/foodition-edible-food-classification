# Project overview

This project aims to classify edible food or inedible food using deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow Keras. The goal is to create a robust multi-classification model that can accurately classify edible and inedible food.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model is built using the TensorFlow Keras libraries. The architecture typically involves:

- Preprocessing the food images(convert to RGB, resize, convert to array)
- Define pre-trained model MobileNetV2 with input
- Creating a classifier layer and output layer
- combine pre-trained model with classifier layer and output layer with 15 neuron
- Compiling the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer
- Training the model on the dataset
