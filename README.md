# Project overview

This project aims to classify edible food or inedible food using deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow Keras. The goal is to create a robust binary classification model that can accurately classify edible and inedible food.

# Technology we to use in model
- Python : The main programming language will be used in this project 
- TensorFlow/scikit-learn : Framework for building a model.
- Keras API from TensorFlow : an API from tensorflow for building a model.
- Git/GitHub : Version control and collaborative development.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn : Useful to visualize data used for ML development.
- Numpy :  Open-source library for data preparing and manipulating.
- Pre-trained model for image classification : for transfer learning on marine product grading model .
